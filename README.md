# Wilkins on the Farm
This is a version of wilkinsonthefarm.com made through the Middleman framework. So far it is incomplete, but really only 
lacks responsiveness at the moment. I started making it for fun (which explains the mixture of .erb and HAML files) but I will eventually complete and implement it.
